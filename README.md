BIoMT-VFL: Blockchain-Secured Vertical Federated Learning for IoMT
💡 Overview
This project introduces BIoMT-VFL, a framework that integrates Blockchain with Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) to guarantee security and privacy for collaborative machine learning in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT).

It enables multiple healthcare institutions to train models collaboratively on shared patient data (with different feature sets) without sharing raw data, while using the blockchain to provide auditable, tamper-proof security for model updates.

Core Technologies
Vertical Federated Learning (VFL): Enables feature-disparate data silos to learn together privately.

Blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger): Secures model aggregation and participant interactions.

IoMT: Focuses on sensitive medical data and secure collaborative training.

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites
